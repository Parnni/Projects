## Overview
Our task here is to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. I have developed the model using Convolutional Neural Network and trained it
on MNIST dataset. 
Few skills that I gathered during the project are: -
- Using Convolutional and Dense layers.
- Managing the number of Convolutional and Dense layers.
- Managing the number of units in the Dense layers.
- Using Dropout and BatchNormalization layers to avoid overfitting and
- Error Analysis.
