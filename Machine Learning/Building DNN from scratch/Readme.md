## Overview
In this project, I have programmed a Deep Neural Network to train a model which classifies 'Cat' and 'non Cat'.
I wanted to check whether my program is capable of reducing the cost or not.

## Motivation
As I am new to Machine Learning, I wanted to make sure that I unterstand the concepts thoroughly.

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook

## Result
I was able to program and run the code successfully.

## Credits
I learned the Back Propagation Method from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.
The data used is from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.
