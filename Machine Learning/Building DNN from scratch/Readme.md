## Overview
In this project, I have programmed a Deep Neural Network from scratch and applied it on a data 'CatvnonCat' to check whether the program is capable of reducing the cost or not.

## Motivation
As I am new to Machine Learning, I wanted to make sure that I unterstand the concepts thoroughly.

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook

## Result
The Deep Neural Network code is running correctly and it is capable of reducing the cost.

## Credits
I learned the Back Propagation Method from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.
The data used is from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.
