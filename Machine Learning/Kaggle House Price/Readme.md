## Overview
This project is based on Kaggle House price competition where we have to predict the price of a House based on some given features. This project consists of: -
- Data cleaning.
- Missing value imputation.
- Feature Engineering.
- Selecting significant features and
- Selecting the best model.

## Motivation
After studying Machine Learning, I wanted to test my concepts. I choosed Kaggle House Price to get a Hands-on experience.

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook
