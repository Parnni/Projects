## Overview
In this project, I have programmed a very simple one layered Neural Network to train an OR gate.

## Motivation
As I am new to Machine Learning, I wanted to make sure that I unterstand the concepts thoroughly.

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook

## Result
I was able to program and run the code successfully.
