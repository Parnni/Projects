## Overview
The project focuses on solving SDOF vibration equation using Euler and Runge-Kutta method. 

## Motivation
I was trying to solve some Engineering problems using Numerical Methods and there I came across Euler's Method of Integration.
I applied it on the equation but the result was unsatisfactory.
